**Objective:** Implement Phase 1, Task 1.2 of the Model Improvement Plan: Replace the arbitrary, linear damage model with a more robust, probabilistic one.

---

### **Execution Summary**

This log details the successful implementation of a critical architectural upgrade to the Project-Gridfall simulators. The core task was to move from a static, deterministic damage scoring system to a probabilistic model using a log-normal distribution, making the simulation more realistic and actuarially sound.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Dependency Installation:**
    *   The `scipy` library, required for handling statistical distributions, was successfully installed.

2.  **Refactored Weekly Model (`simulator.py`, `config.py`):**
    *   In `config.py`, the old `DAMAGE_SCORES` dictionary was deprecated and replaced with a new `DAMAGE_DISTRIBUTIONS` structure. This new structure defines the parameters (`log_mean`, `log_std`) for a log-normal distribution for each criticality level ('high', 'medium', 'low').
    *   In `simulator.py`, the core `run_grid_simulation` function was overhauled. The simple dictionary lookup for damage was replaced with a call to `scipy.stats.lognorm.rvs`, which draws a random damage value from the appropriate distribution for each simulated strike.

3.  **Refactored Daily Model (`daily_model/`):**
    *   The exact same architectural changes were applied to `daily_model/daily_config.py` and `daily_model/daily_simulator.py` to ensure feature parity and maintain the integrity of our experimental model.

4.  **Verification:**
    *   Ran the enhanced weekly simulator, which executed successfully.
    *   Ran the enhanced daily simulator, which also executed successfully.
    *   Observed a slight increase in the standard deviation of the forecasts for both models, which is the expected and correct outcome of introducing more realistic, probabilistic damage values.

**Outcome:**

Both the primary (weekly) and experimental (daily) simulators now use a far more sophisticated and defensible damage model. This directly addresses the single biggest weakness identified in the initial actuarial review and completes Task 1.2 of the model improvement plan. The project is now one step closer to being a truly robust predictive instrument.
