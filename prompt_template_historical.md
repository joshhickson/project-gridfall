*   **`CRITICALITY_DIST`**:
    *   `'high'`: [Provide a probability, e.g., `0.40`]
    *   `'medium'`: [Provide a probability, e.g., `0.50`]
    *   `'low'`: [Provide a probability, e.g., `0.10`]
*   **`SCENARIO_MODIFIER`**: [Choose one: `0.5` (Dispersed), `1.0` (Point Failure), `1.5` (Strategic Priority)]
*   **`TECH_DEPENDENCY_MODIFIER`**: [Choose one: `0.25` (High), `1.0` (Low)]
*   **`POLITICAL_WILL_MODIFIER`**: [Choose one: `1.0` (Medium), `2.0` (High)]

### **Part 2: Weekly Intelligence Summary & Justification**

*Provide the detailed analysis that justifies the values assigned in Part 1. Cite key assertions with sources.*

**1. Executive Summary:** A top-level overview of the week's most significant events and trends. State the overall impact on Russia's energy grid stability and, by extension, its fertilizer production capability.

**2. Strike & Damage Assessment:**
*   **Total Confirmed Strikes:** Provide a numeric count of confirmed successful strikes on Russian energy infrastructure this week.[1, 2]
*   **Target Categorization & Rationale:** List the specific targets hit (e.g., Ryazan refinery, Veshkama 500kV substation) and categorize them as 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low'.[1, 3] Justify the resulting `CRITICALITY_DIST` probabilities.
*   **Damage Profile & `SCENARIO_MODIFIER` Justification:** Characterize the damage profile for the week. Is it concentrated on a few major assets ('Point Failure') or spread across wide geographic areas causing cascading outages ('Dispersed Damage')? [1] Justify your choice for the `SCENARIO_MODIFIER`.
*   **Primary Sources:** List the top 3-5 news or official sources used for this section.

**3. Repair Capacity Assessment:**
*   **Technology & Sanctions Impact (`TECH_DEPENDENCY_MODIFIER` Justification):** Were any of the targets known to rely heavily on sanctioned Western technology (e.g., Siemens/GE turbines, advanced SCADA control systems)? Justify your choice for the `TECH_DEPENDENCY_MODIFIER`.
*   **Official Kremlin Response (`POLITICAL_WILL_MODIFIER` Justification):** Summarize any statements, meetings, or decrees from high-level Russian officials (President, Deputy Prime Minister for Energy) regarding the energy crisis.[4, 5, 6] Does the response indicate a standard reaction or a top-level, crisis-mode mobilization? Justify your choice for the `POLITICAL_WILL_MODIFIER`.
*   **Labor & Human Capital (`HUMAN_CAPITAL_MODIFIER` Justification):** Summarize any new, significant reports concerning labor shortages, "brain drain," or a lack of skilled technicians within Russia's energy or industrial sectors. Justify any recommended change to the `HUMAN_CAPITAL_MODIFIER`.

**4. Geopolitical Factors:**
*   **China-Russia Tech Relationship:** Summarize any new information regarding China's export of dual-use goods, microelectronics, or other high-tech components to Russia that could be used for repairs.[7, 8] Note any signs of friction or leverage being applied by Beijing.

**5. Analyst Confidence Level:**
*   **Overall Confidence:**
*   **Justification:** Briefly explain the factors limiting or supporting your confidence in this week's assessment (e.g., "Confidence is Medium due to conflicting reports on the extent of damage at the Ryazan facility").
