**Objective:** Develop a robust framework for ingesting historical intelligence reports in Markdown format and converting them into structured JSON data for the backtester. This was created in response to user feedback to align with their established workflow.

---

### **Execution Summary**

This log details the development and debugging of a new, automated ingestion workflow for historical data. The goal was to create a script that could parse user-provided Markdown reports and append the data to a master JSON file, streamlining the back-testing process.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Created Historical Prompt (`prompt_template_historical.md`):**
    *   A new prompt template was created, based on the weekly prompt, with the addition of a machine-readable `period_id` field to uniquely identify each historical report.

2.  **Developed Ingestion Script (`ingest_report.py`):**
    *   A new script was created to handle the parsing and data ingestion logic. The script is designed to be run from the command line, taking the path to a Markdown report as an argument.

3.  **Testing and Iterative Debugging:**
    *   The development of the parsing logic required multiple iterations to handle the nuances of the Markdown format. Initial attempts using complex regular expressions proved brittle and failed on complex fields.
    *   The logic was refactored to a more robust, line-by-line parsing method. This approach also required several rounds of debugging to handle specific `Timeout` and `ValueError` errors.
    *   The final, successful version of the script uses a combination of line-by-line processing and targeted, simple regex to reliably extract all necessary data points.
    *   The end-to-end workflow was validated by running the final script on a sample report (`historical_data/W42_test_report.md`) and confirming the creation of a correctly formatted `master_weekly_history.json` file.

**Outcome:**

The project now possesses a robust and validated script, `ingest_report.py`, that provides an efficient workflow for building our historical dataset. The user can now provide historical intelligence as a series of simple Markdown files, and the system can automatically convert them into the structured JSON format required for the critical back-testing and calibration phases outlined in the model improvement plan.
