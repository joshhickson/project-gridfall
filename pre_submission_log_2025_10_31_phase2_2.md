**Objective:** Develop a robust framework for ingesting historical intelligence reports in Markdown format and converting them into structured JSON data for the backtester.

---

### **Execution Summary**

This log details the development and debugging of a new, automated ingestion workflow for historical data. The goal was to create a script that could parse user-provided Markdown reports and append the data to a master JSON file, streamlining the back-testing process.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Created Historical Prompt (`prompt_template_historical.md`):**
    *   A new prompt template was created, based on the weekly prompt, with the addition of a machine-readable `period_id` field to uniquely identify each historical report.

2.  **Developed Ingestion Script (`ingest_report.py`):**
    *   A new script was created to handle the parsing and data ingestion logic. The script is designed to be run from the command line, taking the path to a Markdown report as an argument.

3.  **Testing and Iterative Debugging:**
    *   **Test 1:** Created a sample report, `W42_test_report.md`. The first run of the ingestion script failed due to a `re.error: multiple repeat`, indicating a flawed regular expression.
    *   **Test 2:** Corrected the initial regex error. The script ran but produced a `null` value for the `CRITICALITY_DIST` field, indicating the more complex regex was also failing.
    *   **Test 3:** Pivoted from a complex regex approach to a simpler, line-by-line parsing logic to increase robustness. This test failed with a `Timeout`, which was traced to an incorrect line-splitting command (`'\\n'` instead of `'\n'`).
    *   **Test 4:** Corrected the line-splitting bug. This test failed with a `ValueError`, indicating that the value-parsing regex was incorrectly capturing backticks along with the numbers.
    *   **Test 5:** Corrected the final value-parsing regex. The script executed successfully, and a final verification of the output `master_weekly_history.json` file confirmed that all data, including the complex `CRITICALITY_DIST` dictionary, was parsed and saved correctly.

**Outcome:**

The project now possesses a robust and validated script, `ingest_report.py`, that provides an efficient workflow for building our historical dataset. The user can now provide historical intelligence as a series of simple Markdown files, and the system can automatically convert them into the structured JSON format required for the critical back-testing and calibration phases outlined in the model improvement plan.
