# Project Log: Predictive Simulator for Russian Energy Grid Stability

This document provides a detailed, timestamped log of the development and decision-making process for Project-Gridfall.

---

### **2025-10-30 03:02 UTC - Project Initiation & Planning**
*   **Action:** Received and parsed the initial user request from 'Google Gemini - Convergent Crisis_ US National Security Timeline (project gridfall 10.30.2025).md'.
*   **Analysis:** The core task was to build a Python-based Monte Carlo simulator as specified in the "Project Brief & Implementation Guide for AI Developer."
*   **Action:** A multi-step development plan was created, focusing on setting up the file structure, implementing the code, and ensuring proper documentation.

---

### **2025-10-30 03:02 - 03:05 UTC - Phase 1: Core Development**
*   **Action:** Created the required file structure: `simulator.py`, `config.py`, `changelog.md`, and `README.md`.
*   **Action:** Populated `config.py` with the specified default parameters for the simulation.
*   **Action:** Implemented the full Python code for the Monte Carlo simulation engine in `simulator.py`.
*   **Action:** Identified and installed the necessary `numpy` dependency using `pip install numpy`.
*   **Verification:** Executed `python3 simulator.py` to confirm that the script runs correctly and produces the expected output format.
*   **Action:** Populated `README.md` with the full project brief and `changelog.md` with the first entry, adhering to the specified commit logging protocol.

---

### **2025-10-30 03:05 - 03:07 UTC - Phase 2: Code Review & Refinement**
*   **Action:** Submitted the initial project for a simulated code review.
*   **Analysis:** The review was positive but correctly identified a version control issue: the accidental inclusion of `__pycache__` artifacts.
*   **Action:** Created a `.gitignore` file to exclude `__pycache__/` directories and `*.pyc` files, following standard software engineering best practices.
*   **Action:** Removed the existing `__pycache__` directory to clean the repository.
*   **Action:** Submitted the complete and cleaned project.

---

### **2025-10-30 03:25 - 03:36 UTC - Phase 3: Workflow Tooling & Prompt Engineering**
*   **Action:** At the user's request, provided a detailed summary of the open-source intelligence (OSINT) data collection plan.
*   **Analysis:** Identified the need for a structured prompt to facilitate the weekly data collection process.
*   **Action:** Saved an initial version of a suggested OSINT prompt to `prompt_template.md`.
*   **Action:** Received a more refined, structured prompt from the user, which was superior as it directly mapped analytical outputs to simulator inputs.
*   **Action:** Updated `prompt_template.md` with the refined version.
*   **Action:** Submitted the updated prompt template to the repository.

---

### **2025-10-30 03:43 - 03:47 UTC - Project Handoff & Final Guidance**
*   **Action:** Confirmed that the development phase of the project is complete. The simulator is fully functional and the workflow tools are in place.
*   **Guidance:** Advised the user that the project is now in its **operational phase**.
*   **Guidance:** Recommended that the first prompt should cover the most recent 7-day period (**October 23, 2025, to October 30, 2025**) to ensure the baseline forecast is based on the most current data.
*   **Action:** Received the final instruction to create this intensive project log before the user begins a new task.

---

### **Expected Next Steps**

1.  **New Task Initiation:** The user will start a new task.
2.  **Input Delivery:** The user will provide the first weekly intelligence report, which will have been generated using the refined prompt in `prompt_template.md`.
3.  **Operational Execution:** My next task will be to:
    *   Read and parse the provided intelligence report.
    *   Update the variables in the `config.py` file with the new data from the report.
    *   Run the simulator (`python3 simulator.py`).
    *   Provide the final output (the probability of systemic consequence) to the user, completing the first operational cycle of the project.
