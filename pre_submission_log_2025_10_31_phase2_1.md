**Objective:** Implement Phase 2, Task 2.1 of the Model Improvement Plan: Develop a historical data ingestion framework.

---

### **Execution Summary**

This log details the successful creation of a new, foundational framework for back-testing the Project-Gridfall simulator. The objective was to build the necessary tooling to run the simulator against historical data, which is the first step in the critical validation and calibration phase.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Defined Data Structure:**
    *   A clear and extensible JSON format for storing historical data was defined. Each record represents a discrete time period and contains all necessary input variables for the simulator.
    *   A new `historical_data/` directory was created to house this data.
    *   A sample file, `historical_data/sample_weekly_history.json`, was created with two distinct historical weeks to serve as a test case.

2.  **Created Backtester Script (`backtester.py`):**
    *   A new script was created to serve as the core of the backtesting framework.
    *   The script is designed to:
        *   Load a historical data file (in the new JSON format).
        *   Iterate through each historical period in the file.
        *   For each period, dynamically override the simulator's default configuration in memory using Python's `setattr`.
        *   Call the main simulation and printing function from the existing `simulator` module to generate a full forecast for that historical state.

3.  **Verification:**
    *   The `backtester.py` script was executed.
    *   The script successfully loaded the sample data, ran the simulation for the "Week 42" data, and then ran a separate simulation for the "Week 43" data, printing two distinct and correct forecast outputs.
    *   This confirmed that the end-to-end framework for ingesting historical data and generating period-specific forecasts is fully functional.

**Outcome:**

The project now possesses a robust and repeatable framework for conducting historical back-testing. This completes Task 2.1 of the model improvement plan and paves the way for the data collection and model calibration work to come.
