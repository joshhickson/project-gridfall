This is a consolidated update to bring the project changelog up to date with the significant architectural and feature enhancements implemented as part of the Model Improvement Plan.

*   **Parallel Daily Model:** Created a new, self-contained experimental simulator (`daily_model/`) that operates on a daily cadence, allowing for high-frequency forecasting without altering the primary weekly model.
*   **Enhanced Statistical Output (Phase 1.1):** Upgraded both the weekly and daily simulators to provide a full statistical summary of their forecasts, including mean, standard deviation, and key percentiles (25th, 75th, 95th). This provides a much richer view of the "shape of the risk."
*   **Probabilistic Damage Model (Phase 1.2):** Replaced the arbitrary, linear damage scoring system in both simulators with a more robust and realistic probabilistic model using a log-normal distribution from the `scipy` library.
*   **Back-testing Framework (Phase 2.1):**
    *   Developed a `backtester.py` script capable of reading historical data and running the simulator for each past time period.
    *   Created a robust `ingest_report.py` script to automate the conversion of user-provided Markdown reports into the JSON data format required by the backtester.
    *   Added a `prompt_template_historical.md` to standardize the collection of historical intelligence.
*   **Documentation:** Restored and created numerous log files and planning documents to maintain a clear record of the project's development and strategic decisions.

-------------------

*   Processed the first weekly intelligence report (`Project-Gridfall Intelligence Report Week 43`).
*   Updated `config.py` with new input variables based on the report's analysis.
*   Ran the simulation with the updated configuration.
*   The simulation forecast a 100.00% probability of systemic consequence over the next 24 weeks.

-------------------

*   Initial setup of the project structure, including `simulator.py`, `config.py`, `changelog.md`, and `README.md`.
*   Populated `config.py` with default values.
*   Implemented the core simulator logic in `simulator.py`.
*   Added the project brief to `README.md`.
