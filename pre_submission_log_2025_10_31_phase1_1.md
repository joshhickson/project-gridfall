**Objective:** Implement Phase 1, Task 1.1 of the Model Improvement Plan: Enhance the statistical output of both the weekly and daily simulators.

---

### **Execution Summary**

This log details the successful implementation of the first phase of the model improvement plan. The core task was to upgrade both simulators from providing simple point estimates (median/mode) to a full statistical summary of the forecast timeline.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Enhanced Weekly Simulator (`simulator.py`):**
    *   Modified the `run_grid_simulation` function to return the specific week of collapse, rather than a boolean.
    *   Overhauled the `main` function to collect an array of collapse weeks from all simulation runs.
    *   Implemented calculations for **mean, standard deviation, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and 5th percentile (tail risk)** using the `numpy` library.
    *   Updated the console output to display a new, clearly formatted "TIMELINE ANALYSIS (STATISTICAL SUMMARY)" section.

2.  **Enhanced Daily Simulator (`daily_model/daily_simulator.py`):**
    *   Applied the exact same statistical enhancements to the daily model to ensure feature parity.
    *   All calculations and output text were adapted to a "Day" cadence instead of "Week".

3.  **Verification and Debugging:**
    *   Ran the enhanced weekly simulator, which executed successfully and displayed the new statistical output.
    *   Ran the enhanced daily simulator, which initially failed due to a `AttributeError` caused by a typo in a variable name (`BASELINE_REPAIR_CAPacity_PER_DAY`).
    *   Corrected the typo in `daily_model/daily_simulator.py`.
    *   Re-ran the daily simulator, which then executed successfully and displayed the correct statistical output.

**Outcome:**

Both the primary (weekly) and experimental (daily) simulators now provide a robust, actuarially sound statistical summary of their forecasts. This completes Task 1.1 of the model improvement plan and makes the models' outputs significantly more insightful for risk analysis.
